Current Project: Supervised training loop with NYC Data using LORA
Setup/API Info: https://tinker-docs.thinkingmachines.ai/

#Project overview
This project creates a loop using Lora fine tuning methods and a supervised learning loop to adapt a base language model using tinker API to answer questions about New York City. 

The goal is to understand:
- How supervised learning affects model training
- How LoRA fine tuning is used to amplify results from base LLM
- Benefits of the above approaches
